# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

After creating your GitHub repository, run the following commands to push your local repository:

```bash
# Using your GitHub username (rhuddlestone)
git remote add origin https://github.com/rhuddlestone/social-image.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Creating a Release for Auto-Updates

To enable auto-updates, create a release on GitHub:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Releases" in the right sidebar
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. Set the tag version to "v1.0.0" (matching your plugin version)
5. Set the release title to "Social Image 1.0.0"
6. Add release notes (you can copy from the Changelog section in README.md)
7. Optionally, create a ZIP file of your plugin and attach it to the release
8. Click "Publish release"

## Updating the Plugin Configuration

Before pushing to GitHub, make sure to update these values in social-image.php:

```php
define('SOCIAL_IMAGE_GITHUB_USERNAME', 'rhuddlestone'); // Already set to your GitHub username
define('SOCIAL_IMAGE_GITHUB_REPO', 'social-image'); // This should be correct already
```

## Testing Auto-Updates

To test the auto-update functionality:

1. Install the plugin on a WordPress site
2. Make changes to the plugin code
3. Update the version number in social-image.php
4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub
5. Create a new release with the updated version number
6. Check your WordPress site for the update notification
